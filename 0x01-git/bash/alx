delete echo "ALX" and replace it with echo "ALX School is so cool!"

#!/bin/bash 
echo "ALX"
delete echo "ALX" and replace it with, echo "ALX School" 

delete the first two from the master branch, leave only the second two lines from the update_script branch. This is what it should now be: 
#!/bin/bash
#echo "ALX School"
#
